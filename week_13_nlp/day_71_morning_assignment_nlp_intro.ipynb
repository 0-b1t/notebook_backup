    "Unstructured. Language is fluid. There isn't really a hard rule on the order of words, especially when looking at something like poetry. Also, language is dynamic. Words change. Their meaning changes. People use them in unexpected ways. The main thing being that language is largely arbitrary and doesn't necessarily have a one to one relationship with reality like numbers often do (at least in a prequantum sense)\n",
