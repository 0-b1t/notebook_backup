My feeling are - it’s a distraction because of outrageous number of requirements and effort/cost required. To me, the process is geared towards more established players and as SMB it’s not worth it.I’m curious to hear from the community on your experiences with RFP - do you respond to unsolicited requests? How did it work out for you? Have you won a big contract/license out of RFP?
