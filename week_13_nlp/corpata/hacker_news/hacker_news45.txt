In the past year or so I recall an HN post but now I'm struggling to find it, linked to google slides or PDF.It is about a summit between high level tech executives and maybe Stanford or other academic institutions.  Went into some depth comparing China with the United States for financial markets, startups, technologies, and fintec / payments.  It also discussed how Asia will be able to leapfrog the USA since they aren't saddled with old credit technologies.I recall Safra Catz is on the list of contributors / attendees.Any help tracking this link down would be a huge help!  I've wracked my brain and googled the heck out of it, but so far came up empty.I could've sworn I favorited it, but yeah :(Thank you!
