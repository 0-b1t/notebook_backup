I recently discovered how to break a tough cycle that held me back professionally so wanted to share (in hopes of helping even 1 person like me) and to see how you all manage.I had a bad habit of working until I would burn out, in hopes that I would serendipitously learn a few tricks/hacks and grow. This went on for years. Yet every time I had a moment to reflect, I would realize that I wasn't fulfilled, I learned a few meaningless skills, but wasn't anywhere near my personal / professional goals. So I started doing the following things and it has changed my life:
1) write down how my day went every day
2) document why it went well, want went 'not so well', and what i learned
3) systematically gather feedback from peers and mentors i trustedI now have a couple of months worth of data and can systematically tell when i'll have a great/good/bad day and where i need to focus to grow (e.g., my communications skills). I feel much sharper and more growth and goal oriented - it sounds cliche but i feel like i have found a new lease on my professional life.Curious to hear HN friends how you guys manage it all.
