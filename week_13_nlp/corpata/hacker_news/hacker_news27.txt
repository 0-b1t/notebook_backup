So I've been thinking about this for a while and diversifying services as much as possible (mail, drive, docs etc) but Photos is one service that I can't replace.Of course I take backups of the (super messy) Takeout, and use the API to make (incomplete, lower quality) backups of photos.None are ideal though. So, here's my question, what's your contingency plan if you lose access to your Google account?
