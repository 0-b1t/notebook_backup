Let me put this as simple as I can: 
Writing tutorials on Medium means you are putting them behind a paywall, thus restricting learning opportunities.Medium is not StackOverflow, it limits the number of articles that can be freely read.If you ever learned something from a blog or from stackoverflow do contribute back by sharing your knowledge open on the internet not behind a paywall.
