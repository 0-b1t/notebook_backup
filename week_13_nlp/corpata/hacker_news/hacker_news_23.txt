There is a great article by A16Z "Platforms vs Verticals and the Next Great Unbundling" where they write on how companies like Airbnb, Tinder or Thumbtack started as an alternative to Craiglist's category.Today there are big and active communities in Facebook groups or Subreddits which I believe also could be unbundled and turned into a  businesses like social marketplaces or niche forums. Are there any examples of companies who did that already?
