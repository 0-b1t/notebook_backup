I want to build an iOS app to make my life easier. I'm certain that other people in my line of work have the same problem, and could benefit from a convenient solution. The MVP requirements that I've listed out are complex enough (VOIP capability, some api calls, database stuff) that I'm wondering if I'll be able to do it with an "app building" service or if I'll need to learn how to code it, or pay someone to code it.Not sure this is enough information for a meaningful answer, so happy to chime in as necessary in the comments.
