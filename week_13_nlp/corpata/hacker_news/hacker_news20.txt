Writing Yet Another Static Site Generator and am wondering how much work to put into the MVP's search function. It generates a JSON array of the site keyed by page name, title, and body text. My instinct is simply to do an array filter this time around. If the average site is under, say, 500 pages I assume this will be plenty fast.My Google fu failed with such queries as "how many pages does the average website have", instead returning pages and pages of articles about SEO and the minimum number of pages a site needs.In a world as analytical as web development I'm guessing there must be a ton of studies on this subject, but I can't find them.
