A friend of-a-friend who graduated from a bootcamp at the very beginning of covid-19 (really bad, because the demo day was kneecapped) reached out asking for suggestions on how to go about maximizing the impact of their search.  Does anyone have suggestions for them?  Is the sentiment that hiring juniors is more or less of a thing during covid?
