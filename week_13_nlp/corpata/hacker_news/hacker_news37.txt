The last few weeks have been very disheartening as the disease is spreading more and more rapidly, to the point where any hopes of "getting back to normal" are feeling quite far out of reach.How the hell do we actually/pragmatically solve this thing? Is a widely accessible vaccine the only option? How long will that take?
