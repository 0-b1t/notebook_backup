(Sorry for bad English. Not my first language.)I had just began work at my first job after finishing university studies. About 1 year back, my first task was to hide negative results about an Israeli start-up that had bad news articles about their business stealing code from competitors.It was never wright with me but it was my first job and I followed instructions of the lead who I was working on this client task with.After a weeks of work, we showed the results to client and the news stories were not appearing in the first pages of Google any more longer.I am stuck on visa and finding jobs is challenging. I have now completed multiple projects of this type of work. I just want to check what does everyone on HN think of this? Is this considered wrong?
