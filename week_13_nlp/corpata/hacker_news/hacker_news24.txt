I’m a first year doctor from Victoria, Australia.
This is my first year working in a team-based context, making decisions for patient management.
I’ve had a number of experiences this year with bosses whose management I disagree with. But I haven’t come up with a useful, constructive means to voice this disagreement. 
Medicine is often a chaotic space to work, which doesn’t help, and your work satisfaction depends fundamentally on your relationships with your team.
Looking to hear any tips from others who have wrestled with this issue.
