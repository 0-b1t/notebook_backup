Hey HN, I'm working on a project for school and need to learn a bit more about the revenue model of custom software dev firms.I've been googling, but can't seem to get a straight answer. It seems like there's an initial project cost & then maintenance revenue ongoing for the software / app's life. Is that accurate?Appreciate any insight y'all can provide!
